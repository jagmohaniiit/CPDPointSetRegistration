# CPDPointSetRegistration
Matlab Implementation of Coherent Point Set Registration (CPD)

CPD: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5432191


This code does both rigid and non rigid registration using EM Algorithm. Note this is an initial version, and will be optimized in non-frequent manner.

Dependencies: Matlab 2020a or onwards with point cloud tools.

To perform rigid registration you need to call
computeRigidRegistration.
For non-rigid registration:
computeNonRigidRegistration.
